Media Insights is a tool developed for academic purposes that allows you to analyze YouTube videos, audio files or a given text. It provides features like transcription, summarization, keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, and word cloud generation for multimedia content. It leverages several powerful AI models and libraries by using OpenAI's Whisper for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to transcribe audio content. It summarizes the transcribed text using Facebook's BART model, extracts keywords with VoiceLabT5, performs sentiment analysis with DistilBERT, and generates word clouds.
